# Hydrogen-Bond-Analysis-LAMMPS
LAMMPS trajectory
can be used to compute total number of hydrogen bonds between water, hydronium molecules.
Can be used to compute the time series of all hydrogen bonds in a system which in turn
can be used to compute  an autocorrelation function and relaxation time of the h-bonds.
can also be modified for other donor/acceptor molecules
